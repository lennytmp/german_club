IDEAS:
- Bigger game concept: there is map with cities (tree). You can buy/sell things in various cities and carry them with you.
  On your way you encounter events (some paths might be more dangerous). You may get a trader that you can trade with or attack. You may get a monster.
- More fun: ask LLM to describe what happened given the damage to player1 and player2.
- Add a shop
- Add leaderboard / stats
- Fight many to many, many to one
- Generate fantasy names
- Injuries when hit by more hp than you have
