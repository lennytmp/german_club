TODO:
- Bots can attack first
- Shop
  - Add a button "Marketplace". When the player hits it, they meet a random trader, the trader has a randomized inventory.
    The player gets the description of that inventory.

IDEAS:
- Bigger game concept: there is map with cities (tree). You can buy/sell things in various cities and carry them with you.
  On your way you encounter events (some paths might be more dangerous). You may get a trader that you can trade with or attack. You may get a monster.
- Fight many to many, many to one
