# Build and Test Validation Rules

## Use build.sh for validation
- Before making any code changes that could affect compilation or tests, run `./build.sh` to validate the current state
- After making code changes, always run `./build.sh` to ensure:
  1. The code compiles successfully
  2. All tests pass
  3. The build completes without errors

## Build Script Requirements
- The `build.sh` script handles both compilation and test execution
- It compiles Java files to `build/classes` directory
- It runs the test suite using `ClientTest` class
- Exit code 0 indicates success, non-zero indicates failure

## Validation Process
1. **Before Changes**: Run `./build.sh` to establish baseline
2. **After Changes**: Run `./build.sh` to validate changes
3. **Error Handling**: If build fails, fix compilation errors before proceeding
4. **Test Failures**: If tests fail, address test failures before considering changes complete

## Code Quality Standards
- All Java files must compile without warnings when possible
- All existing tests must continue to pass
- New functionality should include appropriate tests
- Use assertions (`-ea` flag is enabled) for runtime validation

## Dependencies
- Project uses Gson 2.8.6 library (`lib/gson-2.8.6.jar`)
- Classpath includes both compiled classes and external libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Validate before starting work
./build.sh

# Validate after making changes
./build.sh

# Check exit code programmatically
./build.sh && echo "Build successful" || echo "Build failed"
```

## Additional Guidelines
- Always test changes locally using `build.sh` before committing
- If `build.sh` fails, investigate and fix issues immediately
- Maintain the build script's cross-platform compatibility
- Keep the test suite comprehensive and up-to-date
